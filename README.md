# Single token farm

A dapp that allows people to create staking farms with rewards, and other people to stake and get rewards, fully permissionlessly. Developed by [Trove Labs](https://github.com/Trove-team) for [speedbuild](https://t.me/speedbuild).

This repo tries to be easy-to-fork-and-deploy MVP, so that if you have time, you can build a real business around this product.

Some things that would need to be done for an actual project (if you decide to fork it):

- Business model. Can be a simple fee, or anything you want
- Better filtering and navigation in the frontend, the current navigation is not scalable and easy to spam
- Embeddable widget, so that projects can use it on their own websites to allow users to stake / unstake their token
